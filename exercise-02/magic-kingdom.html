        <h2>Lands</h2>
            
        <p>Magic Kingdom is divided into six themed "lands." It is designed like a wheel, with the hub in front of Cinderella Castle. Pathways spoke out from the hub across the 107 acres (43 ha) of the park and lead to these six lands. The Walt Disney World Railroad circles around the entire 1.5-mile (2.4 km) perimeter of the park and makes stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, and Fantasyland.</p> 
            
        <h3>Main Street, U.S.A.</h3>

        <p>Main Street features </p> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>a train station</li>

            <li>several varieties of horse-drawn and motor-powered vehicles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's "opening credits," where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain), then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors.</p> 
            
        <p>Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style.</p>
        
        <p>The musical soundtrack played at the entrance includes musical selections from the 1943 Broadway musical <i>Oklahoma!</i> and the 1957 Broadway musical <i>The Music Man</i>.</p>

        <p>The Dapper Dans, a men's a cappella singing group, typically perform throughout Main Street.</p>

        <h3>Adventureland</h3>
            
        <p>Adventureland represents the mystery of exploring foreign lands. It is themed to resemble the remote jungles in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America and the South Pacific, with an extension resembling a Caribbean town square.</p>
